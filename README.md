## TASK: 

Create a Dashbord Fullpage image using BS / JQ / API from Unsplash

=> Bootstrap/Jquery/etc standalone OR "startbootstrap-full" (NPM i option doesn't work with it)

=> Use the API from Unsplash (you can use PICSUM PHOTOS - make it easyer!)

=> Select A RANDOM image from /list API and be creative ("should change all the time")


### STEP 1 (15 min.)

Create a Dashbord Fullpage image using BS / JQ / API from Unsplash

=> Bootstrap/Jquery/etc standalone OR "startbootstrap-full" (NPM i option doesn't work with it)

=> Use the API from Unsplash (you can use PICSUM PHOTOS - make it easyer!)

=> Select A RANDOM image from /list API and be creative ("should change all the time")


### STEP 2 (15 min.)

Add a Quote to your dashboard

=> You want to print out the quote and the author

=> Endpoint is https://talaikis.com/api/quotes/random/

=> Style the CSS


### STEP 3 (15 min.)

Add Time and Date

=> Include Moment.js in your project and use it to print the date

=> Make seconds running live

=> Style the CSS


## EXTRA POINT:

=> Don't waste time and bandwith with big pictures... use 1280x1080

=> "JS math": output "my random number is: x/y" (where my random is x e total is y)

=> ES6 would be nice

## WORKFLOW TO SOLUTION (at least one of them...):

=> you should google: startbootstrap-full

=> you should check Picsum docs first, how to https://picsum.photos/list works and other solution

=> you should check Ajax docs if needed: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax

=> you should check For statement if needed: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp

=> you should use console.log to debug what you're dealing with

=> google is your friend... sometimes

## RUN FROM THIS REPO

Clone, run 'npm install' and then run 'gulp dev' which will open up a preview of the template in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the gulpfile.js to see which tasks are included with the dev environment."
